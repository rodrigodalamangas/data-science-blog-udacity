After installing all these libraries in the Anaconda environment, you just need to run the notebook file *data_analysis.ipynb*.

## Project Motivation
This project is being carried out as part of an Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course and its main propose is analyze the AirBnB data sets from Seattle from January 2016 to January 2017 and ask questions to stakeholder. To answer the questions, a Juypter notebook was implemented using the CIRSP-DM process. Data is read, processed, modeled and evaluated in this notebook.
