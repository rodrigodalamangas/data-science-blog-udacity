Finding accommodation is a typical problem faced by travelers when planning a trip. And everyone want to stay in a well located and cozy accommodation, at a fair price. Therefore, this document will try to help you who want to visit Seattle - USA to solve this problem by answering the following questions:

- What is the best time of the year to visit the city? How does the price of accommodation vary according to the time of year?
- Where is the best neighborhood to stay? How much will I spend staying in a good neighborhood?
- What most affects the daily price of an accommodation, the location, the characteristics of the property or the attention of the renter?

If you are interested to check this story, check the jupyter notebook file (*data_analysis.ipynb*) or my [post at medium](https://medium.com/@rodrigodalamangas/planning-a-trip-to-seattle-this-is-why-you-need-to-check-this-data-analysis-effb8e88d11d?sk=9b1e91eee5b683cf3319cfbfe1213e74)

## Installations
This project use the Anaconda environment with Python 3 ([instructions of installing Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)) and the following libraries:
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
- [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)

After installing all these libraries in the Anaconda environment, you just need to run the notebook file *data_analysis.ipynb*.

## Project Motivation
This project is being carried out as part of an Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program and its main propose is analyze the AirBnB Seattle data sets from January 2016 to January 2017 and ask questions to stakeholder. To answer the questions, a Juypter notebook was implemented using the CIRSP-DM process. Data is read, processed, modeled and evaluated in this notebook.

## File Descriptions
All the written study is in the Jupyter Notebook file named *data_analysis.ipynb*. After run this notebook, a folder named *seattle* will be created with all the files used for this analisys (*calendar.csv*, *listing.csv* and *reviews.csv*).
